## Welcome, friend! I'm Howard Huang! ðŸ‘‹

**I am a full-stack software engineer proficient in Javascript.**

I am also learned in using React JS, Node.js, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Agile development. In addition, I am currently striving to improve my skills with C++ and Python. I am interested in useful and fun projects.

I have a strong educational background in Physics and Mathematics and I am now seeking to apply my logical mindset through software development, while continuing to utilize the problem solving, data analysis, and feedback skills that I developed in school. I thrive in a challenging, learning environment and I strongly value innovation, harmony, and continuous learning. My commitment to continuous learning and application of analytical skills is central to driving innovation and efficiency within my professional endeavors.
